# PredictingCarPrice
The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model to predict car prices based on key features such as mileage, engine size, car age, and categorical attributes like brand and transmission type.
To ensure the model performed optimally, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps:

Missing value handling,
Feature Engineering.
Encoding categorical features,
Normaization and
Several regression models were tested, and the best performance was achieved using a Random Forest Regressor.

The model was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score. Low MAE (261.01) indicates minimal prediction error, meaning the model is highly accurate. High R² (0.9878) suggests that 98.78% of the variation in car prices is explained by the model’s features.

The model generalizes well and can be deployed for real-world car price estimation.
